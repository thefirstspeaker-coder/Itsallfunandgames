    "generalRules": [
      "**Objective:** Listen carefully to the leader’s call and act out the correct bean as quickly as possible, including the matching movement and shout where applicable.",
      "**Setup:** No equipment or preparation is needed. Players stand spaced out with room to move safely.",
      "**Gameplay:** The leader calls out the name of a bean, and players perform the matching action and say the associated phrase if there is one:\n1. **String beans** – stretch up as high as you can.\n2. **Broad beans** – make yourself as wide as possible.\n3. **Runner beans** – run on the spot.\n4. **Jumping beans** – jump on the spot.\n5. **Jelly beans** – shake your whole body like jelly.\n6. **Baked beans** – wipe your brow and say loudly, *“Phew!”*.\n7. **Beans on toast** – lie flat on the floor.\n8. **Chilli beans** – shiver as if you are freezing and say, *“Brrr!”*.\n9. **Mr. Bean** – shrug your shoulders and make a confused face, saying, *“Hmm?”*.\n10. **Beanie Baby** – suck your thumb and maybe say, *“Waaah!”*.\n11. **Human beans** – stand proudly and exclaim, *“To bean or not to bean!”*.\n12. **Bean bags** – huddle in a ball on the floor.\n13. **Bean sprouts** – stand tall and thin, stretching upwards.\n14. **French beans** – say *“Ooh la la!”* or *“Bonjour!”* and do a Can-Can kick.\n15. **Coffee beans** – cough dramatically, *“Cough! Cough!”*, covering your mouth.\n16. **Butter beans** – slide around the floor on your bottom saying, *“Slippy!”*.\n17. **Has beans** – walk around as if old and frail, saying, *“Oh, my back!”*.\n18. **Magic beans** – wave an imaginary wand and say, *“Abracadabra!”* or *“Hocus pocus!”*.",
      "**Leader Tips:** Mix up the calls quickly to keep players alert. Gradually speed up or combine two beans to challenge reactions (e.g., *‘Runner Beans and Jelly Beans!’*).",
      "**Variations:** Invite players to create new bean types with fun movements or sounds. Use as a warm-up or listening skills activity.",
      "**End of Game:** Continue until players are tired, or the leader calls *“All beans on toast!”* (everyone lies down to finish)."

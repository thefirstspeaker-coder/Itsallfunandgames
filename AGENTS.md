      "**Objective:** The goal is to be the last player to successfully remove their shoes without causing the bucket to tip or fall.",
      "**Players and Setup:** Four players lie on their backs in a small circle. They should position themselves so their legs are raised and their feet meet in the middle, creating a stable, flat surface.",
      "**The Bucket:** A plastic bucket filled with water is carefully placed on the players' feet. Use a specific amount of water, like a quarter or half full, to make it consistently challenging but not impossible. For a different twist, use other items like blocks or balls instead of water.",
      "**Taking Turns:** The game begins with the player closest to the \"referee\" (or a pre-agreed-upon starting point). Play proceeds clockwise.",
      "**The Challenge:** On each turn, a player must carefully remove one of their shoes using only their hands, while keeping the bucket balanced on the feet \"table.\"",
      "**Losing a Turn:** If the bucket tips or falls during a player's turn, that player is out of the round. All players then reset, and a new round begins with the remaining players."
